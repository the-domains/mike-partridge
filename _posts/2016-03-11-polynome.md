# PolyNome

For anyone who has to practice their instrument, count-off tunes, work out complex polyrhythmic figures, or is just interested how rhythms can work together or against one another I can't recommend [PolyNome][0] enough. 

There are very few things I can think of, if any, that this metronome app can't do. Personally I use it mainly for running count-offs for the various bands I'm in. I'm able to have it play the basic (and sometimes not so basic) grooves for a couple of bars which really helps me get inside the essence of the song before it starts. There's nothing worse than that dreaded 'how does this song go again?' when dealing with under-rehearsed gigs. With this I don't have to worry about that at all and can focus on nailing the groove from beat one.

With my love of more challenging music it can be frustrating when I can't quite get my head around how to phrase certain odd subdivision passages or solo over poly-rhythmic vamps. This app lets you set two metronomes against each other, each being totally programmable in itself. That's invaluable for allowing the feel of what you're trying to rhythmically achieve really sink in when practicing. 

Anyway, as you can tell, I'm a fan of this app. I use it practicing, teaching, and on stage. It's been developed by one guy, Joe Crabtree, and his computer too. His site is worth checking out for some great drum lessons and general content around the world of drumming. Find it [here][1]. For more info about Polynome click [here][2].

Happy music making y'all.
